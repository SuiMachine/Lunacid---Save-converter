# Lunacid---Save-converter
A save converter that can convert binary formatted saves or config files into human readable xml format and back.

**Important:** I do not take the responsibility for corrupted saves. Use it at your own risk!

Drag and drop a save file (e.g. SAVE_0.MIDNIGHT) onto the exe to convert it to XML. Drag and drop XML to convert it back to MIDNIGHT binary file.

Alternatively launch it with command line:
