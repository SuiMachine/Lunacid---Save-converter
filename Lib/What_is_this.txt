This is essentially a cut down version of original game assembly containing only the class used for storing player progress with a removed constructor that was causing issues.

This is done for two reasons:
1. Because the presence of the constructor and its references to ecalls of Vector3 were causing issues with binary serialization.
2. Because this library still has to be distributed along with the exe for the binary serialization to work properly (or for binary desarialization to happen).
